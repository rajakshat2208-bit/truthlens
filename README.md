# TruthLens

TruthLens is an AI-powered backend system designed to analyze information from multiple sources and highlight **what is commonly agreed upon, what differs, and how narratives are framed**.

Instead of deciding what is “true” or pushing opinions, TruthLens focuses on **transparency, explainability, and cross-source comparison**, helping users understand *where information aligns and where it diverges*.

---

## Why TruthLens Exists

In today’s information ecosystem:
- The same event is reported differently by different sources
- Facts, interpretations, and narratives are often mixed together
- People argue without clearly understanding *where* the disagreement actually is

TruthLens was built to address this gap by separating:
- **Common facts** shared across sources
- **Source-specific claims**
- **Narrative differences in wording and emphasis**

The system does **not act as a judge**.  
It acts as a **lens**.

---

## What TruthLens Does

TruthLens:
- Ingests articles from multiple sources
- Breaks content into sentence-level claims
- Groups semantically similar claims using AI
- Identifies agreement and divergence across sources
- Produces explainable, structured output

The goal is clarity — not verdicts.

## How It Works (High-Level)

Multiple Articles
↓
Sentence-Level Claim Extraction
↓
Semantic Similarity Analysis
↓
Cross-Source Grouping
↓
Explainable Output



Each step is designed to be transparent and interpretable.

## Example Use Case

**Input:**
- Article from Source A
- Article from Source B

**Output:**
- Common fact: “An investigation is ongoing”
- Source-specific phrasing differences
- Clear grouping showing agreement and divergence

This helps users understand *how* information differs, not just *that* it differs.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Semantic similarity models
- Modular backend architecture

---

## Project Status

This project is an **early-stage backend prototype (v0.1)**.

Current focus:
- Core intelligence
- Clean architecture
- Explainable outputs

Planned future enhancements:
- Narrative framing analysis
- Misinformation risk indicators
- Frontend interface
- Deployment and scalability improvements

---

## Ethical Position

TruthLens:
- Does **not** declare absolute truth
- Does **not** promote propaganda
- Does **not** replace human judgment

It is built to support **responsible information analysis** by improving transparency and understanding.

---

## Vision

TruthLens aims to become a foundation for:
- Responsible media analysis
- Research and education
- Transparent information systems
- Tools that empower users rather than manipulate them
